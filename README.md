## üî¨ Research Experience

### Bachelor‚Äôs Graduation Thesis
**Project**: Transformer-Based Graph Networks for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Classification using Filtered EEG Signals  
- **Achievements**:
  - Developed an EEG artifact removal model using LU-Net to improve signal quality.
  - Created an effective feature set through extensive experimentation and analysis.
  - Co-authored a research paper (in progress) on experimental setup, model development, and performance evaluation.

### Research Assistant Intern
- **Focus**: Implemented post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) tools to enhance ML models in a Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) data-centric framework.
  - Conducted experiments on Arabic emotion classification using LIME and SHAP for model interpretation.
  - Designed a framework integrating explainability into the model development life cycle.
  - Co-authored a paper titled ‚ÄúX-Deep: A Data-Centric HitL Framework for Conducting Systematic Error Analysis of Arabic NLP Datasets using Explainable AI‚Äù (submitted for review).
